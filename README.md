**The exposure limit criteria used here is 85 dBA, 8 hours, 3 dBA doubling**

The starting stage is "playing_with_data.rmd", the main task of this stage is as follows: 
- verify the daily dose calculation with daily Leq (A-weighted sound level)
- verify the daily Leq via moment Leq (every 2.75 minutes as well as 0.0625 hours)
- compare the daily dose difference via "daily Leq" directly or "cumulative moments' Leq"
